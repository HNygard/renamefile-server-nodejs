Install node packages:
    npm install

Make the app accessible from command line:
    ln -s `pwd`/renamefile-server-nodejs.sh ~/bin/renamefile-server

Go into any directory in your terminal and start the app:
    renamefile-server

TODO:
- Refresh / new file after renaming
- Image viewer - Zoom and pan (maybe https://github.com/benlumley/jQuery-PanZoom)
- Images can be moved into folders when renaming (categories)
